                            <strong>Australia</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br> Great Barrier Reef, complex of coral reefs, shoals, and islets in the Pacific Ocean off the
                            northeastern coast of Australia that is the longest and largest reef complex in the world. The
                            Great Barrier Reef extends in roughly a northwest-southeast direction for more than 1,250 miles
                            (2,000 km), at an offshore distance ranging from 10 to 100 miles (16 to 160 km), and has an area
                            of some 135,000 square miles (350,000 square km). It has been characterized, somewhat inaccurately,
                            as the largest structure ever built by living creatures.
                            <br>
                            <br> The reef actually consists of some 2,100 individual reefs and some 800 fringing reefs (formed
                            around islands or bordering coastlines). Many are dry or barely awash at low tide; some have
                            islands of coral sand, or cays; others fringe high islands or the mainland coast. In spite of
                            this variety, the reefs share a common origin: each has been formed, over millions of years,
                            from the skeletons and skeletal waste of a mass of living marine organisms. The “bricks” in the
                            reef framework are formed by the calcareous remains of the tiny creatures known as coral polyps
                            and hydrocorals, while the “cement” that binds these remains together is formed in large part
                            by coralline algae and bryozoans. The interstices of this framework have been filled in by vast
                            quantities of skeletal waste produced by the pounding of the waves and the depredations of boring
                            organisms.

                            <br>
                            <br>The Harbor of Rio de Janeiro is located in Brazil and was created by erosion from the Atlantic
                            Ocean and is also known as Guanabara Bay. Guanabara Bay was formed naturally by the Atlantic
                            Ocean. Over time, the sea eroded the rocks and sand developing the bay we recognize today. The
                            erosion occurred in such a way that if you look at the bay from different angles, it can look
                            like a river mouth, or even a lake. Guanabara Bay, or the Harbor of Rio de Janeiro, is the world’s
                            largest natural deep-water bay in the world, based on the volume of water in it.
                            <br>
                            <br>It is the second largest bay in area in Brazil (after the All Saints’ Bay), at 412 square kilometers
                            (159 square miles), with a perimeter of 143 kilometers (89 miles). The Harbor of Rio de Janeiro
                            is 31 kilometers (19.2 miles) long and 28 kilometers (17.3 miles) wide at its maximum. The Harbour
                            is surrounded by gorgeous granite monolith mountains that include the famous Sugar Loaf Mountain
                            at 395 meters (1,296 feet), Corcovado Peak at 704 meters (2,310 feet), and the hills of Tijuca
                            at 1021 meters (3,350 feet).

                            <br> Everest is 29,035 feet or 8848 meters high. The summit is the border of Nepal to the south and
                            China or Tibet on the north. It is over 60 million years old. Everest was formed by the movement
                            of the Indian tectonic plate pushing up and against the Asian plate. Everest grows by about a
                            quarter of an inch (0.25") every year. It consist of different types of shale, limestone and
                            marble. The rocky summit is covered with deep snow all year long.

                            <br> The Jet Stream sits on top of Everest almost all year long The wind can blow over 200 mph The
                            temperature can be -80F In mid May each year, the jet stream moves north causing the winds the
                            calm and temperatures to warm enough for people to try to summit. This is called the 'summit
                            window'. There is a similar period each fall in November. It can also be very hot with temperatures
                            over 100F in the Western Cwm, an area climbers go through to reach the summit.

                            is called Chomolungma by the Tibetan people. It means mother goddess of the universe. Everest
                            was named Sagarmatha by the Nepal Government. It means goddess of the sky. It was first identified
                            for the western world by a British survey team lead by Sir George Everest in 1841. Everest was
                            first named Peak 15 and measured at 29,002 feet in 1856. In 1865, it was named Mount Everest,
                            after Sir George Everest. In 1955, the height was adjusted to 29,028 feet and is still used by
                            Nepal. China uses 29,015 feet as the official height today. Using GPS technology, the summit
                            was measured at 29,035 feet or 8850 meters in 1999. Nepal started to remeasure Everest in 2017
                            due to the 2015 earthquake and will be finished by 2020.

                            <strong>Fairbanks, Alaska</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br> Seeing the astronomical phenomenon known as the northern lights, a.k.a. aurora borealis (literally
                            "northern dawn"), is a bucket-list item for many people. These dramatic curtains of colored light,
                            which appear high in the night sky in the northern hemisphere, are most visible in the middle
                            of the night and the dead of winter, and in remote, dark areas. Humans have seen and made stories
                            about the lights since prehistoric times and, more recently, conducted scientific studies on
                            them. Here are 10 facts you ought to know about the aurora.
                            <br>
                            <br> The ethereal glow comes from collisions [PDF] between fast moving electrons from the magnetosphere
                            (the region of space controlled by Earth’s magnetic field) and oxygen and nitrogen molecules
                            in our upper atmosphere. Electrons transfer some of their energy to these molecules when they
                            collide; this transfer of energy is said to “excite” them. An excited molecule eventually returns
                            to its non-excited state by releasing photons, or light particles. Large numbers of these collisions
                            create enough light for us to see.
                            <br>
                            <br>The colors of the polar lights depend on whether electrons collide with oxygen or nitrogen, and
                            how energetically. The change in energy between “excited” and original states has a specific
                            value and the resulting photon has a specific color, or wavelength, Don Hampton, a research assistant
                            professor at the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska, tells mental_floss. Oxygen emits greenish-yellow
                            or red light, while nitrogen generally gives off blue light; the blending of these produces purple,
                            pink, and white. Oxygen and nitrogen also emit ultraviolet light, which can be detected by special
                            cameras on satellites but not by the human eye. Researchers can use the different colors to figure
                            out such things as the energy level of the electrons bombarding our atmosphere and creating the
                            aurora.

                            <strong>Michoacán, Mexico</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br> Parícutin is one of the seven natural wonders in the world and is located in Michoacan state,
                            Mexico. It is the youngest volcano in the Western Hemisphere and the reason for being named a
                            “wonder” – its birth was witnessed and studied by people. Parícutin is a scoria-cone volcano.
                            Scoria-cone volcano is a steep, conical hill of volcanic fragments that accumulate around and
                            downwind from a vent.The volcano surged suddenly from the cornfield of local farmer Dionisio
                            Pulido in 1943, attracting both popular and scientific attention.
                            <br>
                            <br>The eruption presented the first occasion for modern science to document the full life cycle
                            of an eruption of this type. For weeks prior, residents of the area reported hearing noises similar
                            to thunder but without clouds in the sky. This sound is consistent with deep earthquakes from
                            the movement of magma. A later study indicated that the eruption was preceded by 21 earthquakes
                            over 3.2 in intensity starting five weeks before the eruption. One week prior to the eruption,
                            newspapers reported 25–30 per day. The day before the eruption, the number is estimated at 300.
                            <br> The eruption began on February 20, 1943, at about 4:00 PM local time. After little more than
                            a day the cone was already 50 meters high (164 feet), and within a week it had reached between
                            100 and 150 meters (330 and 490 feet). It continued to rise, hurling molten matter across the
                            valley.

                            <br>
                            <br>Victoria Falls also known as "Mosi oa-Tunya" ("the smoke that thunders") is positioned almost
                            exactly half way along the mighty Zambezi River's 2700 km journey from it's source to the sea.
                            <br> Here the river plunges headlong into a 100m vertical chasm spanning the full one-and-a-half
                            kilometre width of the river. Creating the biggest curtain of falling water in the world and
                            also one of the seven natural wonders of the world. The power of the falls is awesome with the
                            highest ever flow recorded in 1958 (read more about this flood and the mythology surrounding
                            it) when it reached more than 700 000 cubic meters of water a minute. The water in the gorges
                            rose 18 metres (60 feet) above its normal flood level.
                            <br> This constant pounding by the currents of the mighty Zambezi has, over the millennium, cut through
                            the rock faults and fissures and carved out not one but eight successive precipices (and now
                            the ninth has begun). When our early ancestors inhabited this area some 1.5 million years ago,
                            they would have seen a different Victoria falls to he one we see today.

                            <br>Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything that is
                            Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife team
                            have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source interesting
                            and unique produce from land, sea and mountains.
                            <br>
                            <br>Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more obscure
                            products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and Extreme
                            Stems, with newer dishes such as Waters of Nanay featuring piranha fish served in an entire,
                            sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea level
                            to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses.

                            <br>
                            <br> Great Barrier Reef, complex of coral reefs, shoals, and islets in the Pacific Ocean
                            off the
                            northeastern coast of Australia that is the longest and largest reef complex in the world.
                            The
                            Great Barrier Reef extends in roughly a northwest-southeast direction for more than 1,250
                            miles
                            (2,000 km), at an offshore distance ranging from 10 to 100 miles (16 to 160 km), and has an
                            area
                            of some 135,000 square miles (350,000 square km). It has been characterized, somewhat
                            inaccurately,
                            as the largest structure ever built by living creatures.
                            <br>
                            <br> The reef actually consists of some 2,100 individual reefs and some 800 fringing reefs
                            (formed
                            around islands or bordering coastlines). Many are dry or barely awash at low tide; some
                            have
                            islands of coral sand, or cays; others fringe high islands or the mainland coast. In spite
                            of
                            this variety, the reefs share a common origin: each has been formed, over millions of
                            years,
                            from the skeletons and skeletal waste of a mass of living marine organisms. The “bricks” in
                            the
                            reef framework are formed by the calcareous remains of the tiny creatures known as coral
                            polyps
                            and hydrocorals, while the “cement” that binds these remains together is formed in large
                            part
                            by coralline algae and bryozoans. The interstices of this framework have been filled in by
                            vast
                            quantities of skeletal waste produced by the pounding of the waves and the depredations of
                            boring
                            organisms.

                            <strong>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>The Harbor of Rio de Janeiro is located in Brazil and was created by erosion from the
                            Atlantic
                            Ocean and is also known as Guanabara Bay. Guanabara Bay was formed naturally by the
                            Atlantic
                            Ocean. Over time, the sea eroded the rocks and sand developing the bay we recognize today.
                            The
                            erosion occurred in such a way that if you look at the bay from different angles, it can
                            look
                            like a river mouth, or even a lake. Guanabara Bay, or the Harbor of Rio de Janeiro, is the
                            world’s
                            largest natural deep-water bay in the world, based on the volume of water in it.
                            <br>
                            <br>It is the second largest bay in area in Brazil (after the All Saints’ Bay), at 412
                            square kilometers
                            (159 square miles), with a perimeter of 143 kilometers (89 miles). The Harbor of Rio de
                            Janeiro
                            is 31 kilometers (19.2 miles) long and 28 kilometers (17.3 miles) wide at its maximum. The
                            Harbour
                            is surrounded by gorgeous granite monolith mountains that include the famous Sugar Loaf
                            Mountain
                            at 395 meters (1,296 feet), Corcovado Peak at 704 meters (2,310 feet), and the hills of
                            Tijuca
                            at 1021 meters (3,350 feet).

                            <br>
                            <br> Everest is 29,035 feet or 8848 meters high. The summit is the border of Nepal to the
                            south and
                            China or Tibet on the north. It is over 60 million years old. Everest was formed by the
                            movement
                            of the Indian tectonic plate pushing up and against the Asian plate. Everest grows by about
                            a
                            quarter of an inch (0.25") every year. It consist of different types of shale, limestone
                            and
                            marble. The rocky summit is covered with deep snow all year long.

                            <br> The Jet Stream sits on top of Everest almost all year long The wind can blow over 200
                            mph The
                            temperature can be -80F In mid May each year, the jet stream moves north causing the winds
                            the
                            calm and temperatures to warm enough for people to try to summit. This is called the
                            'summit
                            window'. There is a similar period each fall in November. It can also be very hot with
                            temperatures
                            over 100F in the Western Cwm, an area climbers go through to reach the summit.
                            <br>
                            <br> Like all mountains around the world the local indigenous people were the first to see
                            it. Everest
                            is called Chomolungma by the Tibetan people. It means mother goddess of the universe.
                            Everest
                            was named Sagarmatha by the Nepal Government. It means goddess of the sky. It was first
                            identified
                            for the western world by a British survey team lead by Sir George Everest in 1841. Everest
                            was
                            first named Peak 15 and measured at 29,002 feet in 1856. In 1865, it was named Mount
                            Everest,
                            after Sir George Everest. In 1955, the height was adjusted to 29,028 feet and is still used
                            by
                            Nepal. China uses 29,015 feet as the official height today. Using GPS technology, the
                            summit
                            was measured at 29,035 feet or 8850 meters in 1999. Nepal started to remeasure Everest in
                            2017
                            due to the 2015 earthquake and will be finished by 2020.

                            <br> Seeing the astronomical phenomenon known as the northern lights, a.k.a. aurora
                            borealis (literally
                            "northern dawn"), is a bucket-list item for many people. These dramatic curtains of colored
                            light,
                            which appear high in the night sky in the northern hemisphere, are most visible in the
                            middle
                            of the night and the dead of winter, and in remote, dark areas. Humans have seen and made
                            stories
                            about the lights since prehistoric times and, more recently, conducted scientific studies
                            on
                            them. Here are 10 facts you ought to know about the aurora.
                            <br>
                            <br> The ethereal glow comes from collisions [PDF] between fast moving electrons from the
                            magnetosphere
                            (the region of space controlled by Earth’s magnetic field) and oxygen and nitrogen
                            molecules
                            in our upper atmosphere. Electrons transfer some of their energy to these molecules when
                            they
                            collide; this transfer of energy is said to “excite” them. An excited molecule eventually
                            returns
                            to its non-excited state by releasing photons, or light particles. Large numbers of these
                            collisions
                            create enough light for us to see.
                            <br>
                            <br>The colors of the polar lights depend on whether electrons collide with oxygen or
                            nitrogen, and
                            how energetically. The change in energy between “excited” and original states has a
                            specific
                            value and the resulting photon has a specific color, or wavelength, Don Hampton, a research
                            assistant
                            professor at the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska, tells mental_floss. Oxygen emits
                            greenish-yellow
                            or red light, while nitrogen generally gives off blue light; the blending of these produces
                            purple,
                            pink, and white. Oxygen and nitrogen also emit ultraviolet light, which can be detected by
                            special
                            cameras on satellites but not by the human eye. Researchers can use the different colors to
                            figure
                            out such things as the energy level of the electrons bombarding our atmosphere and creating
                            the
                            aurora.

                            <br> Parícutin is one of the seven natural wonders in the world and is located in Michoacan
                            state,
                            Mexico. It is the youngest volcano in the Western Hemisphere and the reason for being named
                            a
                            “wonder” – its birth was witnessed and studied by people. Parícutin is a scoria-cone
                            volcano.
                            Scoria-cone volcano is a steep, conical hill of volcanic fragments that accumulate around
                            and
                            downwind from a vent.The volcano surged suddenly from the cornfield of local farmer
                            Dionisio
                            Pulido in 1943, attracting both popular and scientific attention.
                            <br>
                            <br>The eruption presented the first occasion for modern science to document the full life
                            cycle
                            of an eruption of this type. For weeks prior, residents of the area reported hearing noises
                            similar
                            to thunder but without clouds in the sky. This sound is consistent with deep earthquakes
                            from
                            the movement of magma. A later study indicated that the eruption was preceded by 21
                            earthquakes
                            over 3.2 in intensity starting five weeks before the eruption. One week prior to the
                            eruption,
                            newspapers reported 25–30 per day. The day before the eruption, the number is estimated at
                            300.
                            <br> The eruption began on February 20, 1943, at about 4:00 PM local time. After little
                            more than
                            a day the cone was already 50 meters high (164 feet), and within a week it had reached
                            between
                            100 and 150 meters (330 and 490 feet). It continued to rise, hurling molten matter across
                            the
                            valley.

                            <br>The Great Wall of China is the world's longest wall and biggest ancient architecture.
                            Its winding path over rugged country and steep mountains takes in some great scenery. It
                            has a stunning array of scenery from the beaches of Qinhuangdao, to rugged mountains around
                            Beijing, to a desert corridor between tall mountain ranges.
                            <br>
                            <br>The official length is 21,196.18 km (13,170.7 mi). Most of today's relics are the Ming
                            Dynasty Great Wall: length 8,851 km (5,500 mi).The Great Wall is more than 2,300 years old.
                            The Ming Great Wall crosses 9 provinces and municipalities: Liaoning, Hebei, Tianjin,
                            Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu. The average height of the Great
                            Wall at Badaling and Juyong Pass is 7.88 meters, and the highest place is 14 meters high.
                            Nearly 1/3 of the Great Wall has disappeared without trace.

                            <br>
                            <br>Christ the Redeemer, Portuguese Cristo Redentor, colossal statue of Jesus Christ at the
                            summit of Mount Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. It was completed in 1931
                            and stands 98 feet (30 metres) tall, its horizontally outstretched arms spanning 92 feet
                            (28 metres). The statue, made of reinforced concrete clad in a mosaic of thousands of
                            triangular soapstone tiles, sits on a square stone pedestal base about 26 feet (8 metres)
                            high, which itself is situated on a deck atop the mountain’s summit. The statue is the
                            largest Art Deco-style sculpture in the world and is one of Rio de Janeiro’s most
                            recognizable landmarks.
                            <br>
                            <br>In the 1850s the Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss suggested placing a Christian
                            monument on Mount Corcovado to honour Isabel, princess regent of Brazil and the daughter of
                            Emperor Pedro II, although the project was never approved. In 1921 the Roman Catholic
                            archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro proposed that a statue of Christ be built on the 2,310-foot
                            (704-metre) summit, which, because of its commanding height, would make it visible from
                            anywhere in Rio. Citizens petitioned Pres. Epitácio Pessoa to allow the construction of the
                            statue on Mount Corcovado.

                            <br>
                            <br>Of ancient civilizations in the Americas, only the Mayan civilization comes near to
                            rivaling the Inca civilization. This is why today we will explore one of the most important
                            Inca cultural marvels - The Machu Picchu. The Machu Picchu is credited to Pachacutec Inca
                            Yupanqui (1438–71) and Tupac Inca Yupanqui (1472–93). Below are some more interesting facts
                            about the place. The first Westerner to discover Machu Picchu was Hiram Bingham, who was
                            looking for the lost Inca site of Vilcabamba but instead stumbled upon the Machu Picchu
                            settlement.
                            <br>
                            The Peruvian government has been petitioning the US government for the return of over 40
                            thousand artifacts collected by Hiram Bingham and taken to the Yale University. They
                            consist of mummies, bones, ceramics and precious metals.The Machu Picchu ruins were
                            declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and are in the list of the 7 wonders of the
                            modern world. The Machu Picchu is perched at the altitude of 2,400 meters (7,875 ft.) above
                            sea level.
                            The settlement was strategically nestled on a mountain range through which the River
                            Urubamba flows.
                            The 'Lost City of Incas' as it is commonly referred in Peru is the most important
                            archaeological site in South America and is regularly frequented by tourists from all over
                            the world.

                            <strong>Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>Chichen Itza was a Mayan city on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Although it’s an
                            important tourist attraction, Chichen Itza also remains an active archeological site. New
                            discoveries are still being unearthed in the area, providing even more insight into the
                            culture and accomplishments of the Mayan people, who ruled much of present-day Mexico and
                            Central America prior to the arrival of European colonists. Chichen Itza was named a UNESCO
                            World Heritage Site in 1988 and, in 2007, it was voted in a global survey as one of the New
                            Seven Wonders
                            <br>
                            <br>Chichen Itza is located about 120 miles from the modern-day resort town of Cancun, on
                            Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. The name Chichen Itza is a Mayan language term for “at the
                            mouth of the well of the Itza.” The Itza were an ethnic group of Mayans who had risen to
                            power in the northern part of the Yucatan peninsula, where the city is located. The well in
                            the name refers to a number of underground rivers that run beneath the region and likely
                            served as the source of water for the city. This easy access to water made the location
                            perfect for a city the size of Chichen Itza
                            <br>
                            <br>Historic accounts differ as to when Chichen Itza was built and ultimately developed
                            into a center of political and economic power. Some accounts place the establishment of the
                            city in the early 400s A.D., while others suggest construction started a few years later,
                            in the middle part of the fifth century. What isn’t up for debate is that Chichen Itza was
                            a significant center of political and economic activity in the Mayan culture by roughly 600
                            A.D. By then, it was already one of the largest cities in the Mayan world, covering nearly
                            two square miles with densely packed commercial, residential and other structures made of
                            stone. Chichen Itza even had its own “suburbs,” with smaller homes occupying the outskirts
                            of the city.

                            <br>The name 'Colosseum' is derived from the Latin word 'colosseus' meaning colossal. This

                            beneath the Colosseum was called the Hypogeum (meaning underground). The hypogeum consisted
                            of two-level subterranean network of tunnels and 32 animal pens. It had 80 vertical shafts
                            which provided instant access to the arena for animals and scenery.

                            <br>
                            <br>One of the most significant Mughal Empire architectural marvels still stands in all its
                            beauty and finesse in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. The Taj Mahal is a white marble built by
                            Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. In Arabic, the Taj
                            Mahal is known as "crown of palaces". It is said to be the jewel of Islamic art in a nation
                            that is predominantly Hindu. As if to show case the expanse of the Mughal Empire, it
                            combines architectures from all the corners of the Empire including Islamic, Persian,
                            Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles. Below are some facts that you may find
                            interesting about Taj Mahal.
                            <br>
                            <br>TLegend has it that Emperor Shah Jahan intended to build another Taj Mahal in black
                            marble across the river but a war with his sons interrupted these plans. The changing moods
                            of the Emperors wife are well captured by the changing hues of the Mausoleum at different
                            times of the day. It takes a pinkish hue in the morning, milky white in the evening and
                            golden at night when illuminated by moonlight.
                            <br>
                            It intricate work of art and architectural genius took 17 years to complete. The most
                            recognizable feature is the white dome at the peak of the mausoleum. Often called the
                            'onion dome', it rises to about 35 meters (115 feet) and is surrounded by four other domes.
                            Taj Mahal is a famous Indian landmark and tourist magnet, attracting more than a million
                            tourists every year. As always, rumor mills are on the overdrive about this mausoleum. It
                            is rumored that the Emperor ordered that all the workers who worked on the mausoleum get
                            their hands chopped of so that no one could make anything like it ever again.

                            <br>CAlso called Al-Batrā in Arabic, Petra is a historical and archaeological city located in southern Jordanian governorate of Ma'a. The city has managed to 'wow' the world with its elaborate stone-cut architecture as well as water conduit system. The city is also fondly referred to as the 'Rose city' due to the color of the stone out of which it is carved. Below are a few interesting facts about the city that may induce you into trying out the Middle East tourism.
                            <br>
                            <br>Among the Petra's amazing architecture, The Treasury is the most popular. It is estimated to be over 2000 years.The Bedouin of the Arabian Desert have destroyed some of the most priceless carvings on the Treasury's walls. They used the carvings as target during their shooting practice. The structures on most of the Petra Archaeologicalsite have been weakened by the salt that is blown from the dead sea and which crystalizes on the building's columns. Petra is though to have been built during the Byzantine Era of the 5th and 6th AD when Petra became an important Christian center. Petra is home to over 800 carved tombs. Petra is more popular for its 800 individual monuments that includes buildings, tombs, baths, funerary halls, temples, arched gateways, and colonnaded streets, that were mostly carved from the kaleidoscopic sandstone.  The city was first established in 312 BC; making it one of the oldest metropolises in the world.
